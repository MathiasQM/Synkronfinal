                    realizing Roots & Hybrid Festival 2022 and setting the
                    visual tone of the festival was a huge blast for us.<br><br>

                    Roots & Hybrid Festival is a yearly event curated by the foundation and crew of Turkis Aarhus.
                    Many things can be said about Turkis and their numerous initiatives, but for us it's definitely
                    their dedication to keeping an open mind, to staying curious and to welcome eclectic crossovers
                    between genres, art and music - this all resonates so well with us.<br><br>

                    Throughout the collab we had several meeting with the organizers in order to set the visual tone of
                    the festival. We researched on their identity, and the visual designs of past events before created
                    a series of posters where a final winner was picked. Upon delivery we created a package of graphical
                    assets which the communications manager could use to promote the festival on all their digital
                    platforms.<br><br>

                    The graphic design carried through from the digital promotions to the physical poster design and to
                    the animated announcement visuals at the venue making it easy for participants to distinguish the
                    festival and connect to it across platforms and finally experience visuals unfold in a series of
                    immersive concert experiences.<br><br>

                    <span class="description-title">Products:</span><br><br>We were hired by
                    Turkis to do graphic design, live visuals and aftermovie
                    for the Roots & Hybrid Festival 2022, but in the end it became so much more. <br><br>

                    By tying the different mediums together we managed to create a visual tone of the festival which
                    carried through on everything from the digital platforms, to the physical urban environment of the
                    city, to the venue of the festival and after.<br>
